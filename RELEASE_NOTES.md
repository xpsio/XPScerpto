# XPScerpto v9 — Final Publishable Package

This package merges the organizational improvements of v9 with a **fully expanded, deeply developed documentation set**.

## What’s inside
- Updated **README.md** (professional index, Quick Start, CI summary)
- Deep, expanded docs in `docs/`:
  - ARCHITECTURE.md, USAGE_GUIDE.md, SECURITY_SPEC.md, PERFORMANCE.md
  - CONFIG.md, OBSERVABILITY.md, ERROR_TAXONOMY.md, PQC_GUIDE.md
  - WORKFLOWS.md, DIAGRAMS.md (Mermaid compliant with project rules)

## Notes
- Existing CI and project files from v9 are kept intact.
- Mermaid diagrams follow the linter rules (no `note over`, no `|label|`, no parentheses in node labels).
- Adjust namespaces in examples (`xps.crypto.*`) to your actual module names if they differ.
